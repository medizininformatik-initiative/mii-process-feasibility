# Feasibility Processes

Business processes for the MII feasibility project as plugins for the [Data Sharing Framework][1].

## Usage

For documentation of deployment and configuration of the feasibility processes see the [wiki][2].

## Development

### Build

Prerequisite: Java 17, Maven >= 3.6

Build the project from the root directory of this repository by executing the following command.

```sh
mvn clean package
```

### Testing

For running the feasibility processes you need a working and up-to-date DSF instance by following the
[DSF installation guide][3]. The processes are deployed to the DSF BPE component by adding the JAR file of the latest
stable release of the feasibility process plugin to your `process` folder of the DSF BPE. The processes have to be
configured as outlined in the configuration section in the [feasibility process overview][2].

### Update

For updating the feasibility processes to the latest stable version do the following steps:

  * stop your running DSF BPE instance
  * replace the existing JAR file of the feasibility processes plugin in your `process` folder of you DSF BPE with the JAR
    file of the latest stable release of the feasibility process plugin
  * compare and adjust your existing processes configuration to the configuration options documented in the
    [feasibility process overview][2]

You can test the processes workflows locally by following the [README][4]] in the
`mii-process-feasibility-docker-test-setup` directory.

### Edit

You should edit the *.bpmn files only with the standalone [Camunda Modeler][5], because of different
formatting of the bpmn tools and plugins.
